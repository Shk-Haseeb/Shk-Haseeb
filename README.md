## HELLO!

### About Me  

I am a Masterâ€™s student in Data Science who loves working with data to solve real-world problems. I enjoy combining machine learning, web development, and data visualization to build projects from start to finish. Right now, I am exploring Software Architecture and Cloud Development through my academic coursework. Outside of classes, I enjoy sports and hiking, and I am also working on a few personal projects.
